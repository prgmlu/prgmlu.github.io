## how to round to two decimal places in javascript

Let's say you have some numbers like the following:
```javascript
a = 23.3251
b = 1393.3
c = 2334.300251
```

and you want to be consistent so you want to round to 2 decimal places, you want them to be like the following:
```javascript
a = 23.33
b = 1393.30
c = 2334.30
```

**how to do it with javascript?**
The way to do it is with the function `toFixed()`

```javascript
a = 23.3251
b = 1393.3
c = 2334.300251

a = a.toFixed(2)
b = b.toFixed(2)
c = c.toFixed(2)

```
