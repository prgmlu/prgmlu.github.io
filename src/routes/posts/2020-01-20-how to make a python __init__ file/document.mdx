# How to make a python __init__ file

If you've used Python programming language for long enough, you undoubtedly must've came across a file named __init__.py
In this quick guide we will give a practical example of the usage of such a file.

## Practical example:
lets say you have a couple of functions that you use in your code, and you wanted to move these functions to another file and import them in your code.
let's say that you put this code in a file called main_file.py

```python live=true
def helper_function1(a,b):
    return a + b

def helper_function2(a,b):
    return a - b

x = helper_function1(1,2)
y = helper_function2(1,2)

print(x)
print(y)
```

and your project folder now contains only this file like the following image
 <img src={img}/> 

You want to change the code by putting helper_function1 and helper_function2 in a separate file and import them like the following:
```python
from another_file import helper_function1,helper_function1

x = helper_function1(1,2)
y = helper_function2(1,2)

print(x)
print(y)
```
and our files structure would become:
 <img src={img2}/> 

and you can import the needed functions like so:
```python
from another_file import helper_function1,helper_function1

x = helper_function1(1,2)
y = helper_function2(1,2)

```

## A probable scenario:
Imagine you wanted to organize your files by making a directory that you put some helper modules in like the following images:

**a directory for the helper modules**:
 <img src={img3}/> 
 <img src={img4}/> 

in that case you need to create an empty __init__.py file inside the helper modules directory like the following:
 <img src={img5}/> 

 **notice that the __init__ is completely empty, all you need is to create it**

 after creating the empty __init__ file inside the directory you want to import from, you can import the items you need like the following:

```python
from some_directory import another_file, second_file

```

**OR**:

```python
from some_directory.another_file import *
from some_directory.second_file import *

```
