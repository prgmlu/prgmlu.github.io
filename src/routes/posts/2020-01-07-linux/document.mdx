## How to copy all thee files and folders from a directory to another from the linux shell

First let's create a 2 directories, each with files and directories inside them with the following set of bash commands:
```bash
mkdir dir1
mkdir dir2
#creating files inside each dir
touch dir1/y
touch dir2/y
#creating directories inside each dir
mkdir dir1/child_dir
mkdir dir2/child_dir
```


**Trying the straightforward**:

```bash
cp dir1 dir2
```
will not work.

**what you need to use is the flag -r which means recursively.**

*to to copy all thee files and folders from a directory to another from the linux shell use the following:*

```bash
cp -r dir1 dir2
```
