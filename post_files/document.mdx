## How to easily use ssh step by step

Recently in one of my projects, I had to run an `EC2` instance on `AWS`, and I needed to connect to it.

**After some research here's how I did it on ubuntu:**
- create a file named 'config' inside .ssh folder in your root directory.
- fill it with the equivalent information about your host.

<!-- * <img src='desktop/ssh.png'> * -->

<!-- {/* <img src = {ssh} /> */} -->

After that you can connect to it with the following commands:
```bash
ssh instagramproject
```

and you should be connected.
